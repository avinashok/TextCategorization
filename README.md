To run a demo, use the command: $python '/Codes/CommentCategorizationMain.py' -W ignore::DeprecationWarning

Things left to do:
1. Fix bugs.
2. Correct "requirements.txt" file with actual requirements.
3. Write the blog post & link it with the repository for better understanding.

Any suggestions towards improving the code is much appreciated.
